open-channel: '# I will serve: problem={problem}, service={service}\n#  with arguments: '
feedback_source: '# This feedback in english comes from the dictionary of the phrases .yaml file ({self.messages_book_file}) contained in the folder where service {self.ENV.service} is implemented.'

#NOW THE PROBLEM SERVICE SPECIFIC SECTION:

seed-service: '# The service is running with seed={seed_service}'
explain-protocol: '# Each instance describes a 0,1-matrix. Print \'y\' if this matrix can be turned off with the allowed moves, otherwise print \'n\'. After printing 'y', if the service has been called with the flag \'with_check_of_sol\' set to 1, you should also print, in the following line, a solution, i.e., a sequence of moves leading to the all zero matrix (example: r1 c3 r5)'
wrong: '# No!The solution of the matrix of seed={_} is not correct.'
semi-correct: '# The solution of the matrix of seed={_} is not minimum.'
not-efficient: '# No. Your solution is not efficient. Run on your machine, it took more than one second to compute the solution.'
efficient: '# ♥ Ok. Your solution is efficient.'
correct: '# ♥ Your solution is the best one.'

This folder is a good place where to put your solutions.
In this way, you can use the scripts that automate your submitting and/or
yielding of your solutions without having to modify the default values in
their defaults.py configuration file.

You should also adhere to our conventions for the names of the files.
If the name of the instance was:
   instance_003.only_strings.txt
or
   instance_003.with_m_and_n.txt
then our choice for a corresponding solution file would be:
   opt_sol_003.annotated_subseq.txt
or
   opt_sol_003.subseq.txt
or
   opt_sol_003.only_val.txt
depending on the format choosen for expressing your solution.

However, with some ticklering you can adapt these conventions on your local
system, though we advise you not to complicate things unless you are aware of where you are moving and why.

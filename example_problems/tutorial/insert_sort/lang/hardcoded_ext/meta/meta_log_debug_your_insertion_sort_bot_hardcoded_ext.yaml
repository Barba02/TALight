  log_debug_your_insertion_sort_bot:
    description: |+
     In a call to this service you plug in your insert_sort bot running on an instance of yours, in local, and we debug its behavior based on a log sent to our service and offering all of the following observable updates.
        #LOG_input_array <n> <input_array_of_length_n>
        #LOG_memory_load_from_pos <i>
        #LOG_memory_write_on_pos <i>
        #LOG_compare_what_in_pos <i> less_than_what_in_pos <j> <outcome>
        #LOG_output_array <n> <output_array_of_length_n>
     the service either confirms the correct execution of the Insertion Sort algorithm or signal the very first anomaly in its behaviour based only on the log lines (those prefixed by "#LOG_", all other lines are ignored).

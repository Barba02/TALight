not-equal: '# No. You solution is NOT correct. The number of well-formed formulas with {n_pairs} pairs of parentheses is:\n {risp_correct}. Not {risp}.'
not-equiv: '#No. You solution is not correct. The number of well-formed formulas with {n_pairs} pairs of parentheses is {risp_correct}. Taken modulus {ENV["answ_modulus"]} this value boils down to {risp_correct % ENV["answ_modulus"]}. Not {risp}.'
seems-correct-weak: '# Ok. ♥  Your solution correctly computes the number of well formed formulas up to {n_pairs} pairs of parentheses.'
not-efficient: '# No. Your solution is not efficient. Run on your machine, it took more than one second to compute the number of well-formed formulas with {n_pairs} pairs of parentheses.'
seems-correct-strong: '# Ok. ♥  Your solution appears to be correct (checked on several instances).'
efficient: '# Ok. ♥  Your solution is efficient: its running time is logarithmic in the number of formulas it counts.'

    description: We give you a regular expression r and a string s over the same alphabet. Your aim is to recognize whether s belongs to the language described by r. You have control on the size of the instance (r,s) by means of parameters m and n. The instance is pseudo-random and fully spcifified by m,n, and the seed.

      seed:
        explain: Called with seed=random_seed, the service chooses its seed at random (and communicates it to the user). Otherwise, specify a numeric code to reproduce the very same instance as in a previous run.
        regex: ^(random_seed|[1-9][0-9]{5,5})$
        default: random_seed
      m:
        regex: ^([1-9][0-9]{0,1})$
        default: 12
        explain: Length of the regular expression r.
      n:
        regex: ^([1-9][0-9]{0,4})$
        default: 20
        explain: Length of the string s.

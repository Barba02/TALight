In general, filling up this directory with content is not required in order for a problem to run and be served both in local and over the internet. You can decide leaving it empty apart from this README.txt file.
The problem-maker is the one to decide whether providing the materials that are usually placed here, in this folder, is a good thing for her problem to be really complete, considered also if she has time to do so or other priorities to go for.
However: Please, do not remove this directory even if empty.
We want all the GMPL/AMPL modeling problems of this category to have a same structure under many respects.
Uniformity is a value both for didactical and for managing reasons.
Mantaining this organization will smooth and spead up your workflow and guarantee full applicability of any scripts also in the future.

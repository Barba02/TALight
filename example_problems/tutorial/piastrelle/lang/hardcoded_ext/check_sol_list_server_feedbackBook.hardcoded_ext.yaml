open-channel: '# I will serve: problem={problem}, service={service}\n#  with arguments: '
feedback_source: '# This feedback in english comes from the dictionary of the phrases .yaml file ({self.messages_book_file}) contained in the folder where service {self.ENV.service} is implemented.'

#NOW THE PROBLEM SERVICE SPECIFIC SECTION:

at-least-one-line: 'No. You are required to enter at least one valid tailing before closing.'
first-line-not-well-formed: 'No. Your very first tailing is not well formed.'
different_lengths: 'No. The tiling you just introduced (your line {len(input_solution_list)+1}) is different in length from the previous ones.'
repeated: 'No. The well-formed tiling you just introduced (your line {len(input_solution_list)+1}) has already been inserted.'
order-violation: 'No. The well-formed tiling you just introduced (your line  {len(input_solution_list)+1}) does not come after but before the previous one according to the set order (the service was called with 'sorting_criterion'={ENV['sorting_criterion']}).'
your-formulas-all-ok: 'All the tilings you have introduced are ok (well formed).'
one-formula-is-missing-no-feedback: 'No. Your set is missing at least one well-formed tiling.'
list-ok: 'Ok! You have listed all well-formed tilings of a corridor of dimension 1x{n_tiles}. Also their order is the intended one.'
one-formula-is-missing-no-feedback: 'No. Your set is missing at least one well-formed tiling.\nConsider for example:'
not-consecutive: 'In fact, the two tilings:\n {input_solution_list[rank]}\n {input_solution_list[rank+1]}\nthat appear consecutive in your list are NOT consecutive in the intended order. You have missed something inbetween.'
one-missing-minimal-prefix: 'No. Your set is missing at least one well-formed tiling.\nHere is the prefix of a well-formed formula and no formula in your set has this prefix:'
first-missing-till-already-present: 'No. Your set is missing at least one well-formed tiling, but this has no prefix in common with a solution you have given.'
first-missing-till-already-present: 'No. Your set is missing at least one well-formed tiling.\nIn green you find the longest prefix that a solution you are missing has in common with a solution you have given: '
one-missing-prefix-length: 'No. Your set is missing at least one well-formed tiling.\nHere is the prefix of length {length} of a well-formed formula that is missing from the set you entered:'

# NOW THE PROBLEM SERVICE SPECIFIC SECTION:

at-least-one-line: 'No. You are required to enter at least one valid formula before closing.'
first-line-not-well-formed: 'No. Your very first tiling is not well formed.'
different_lengths: 'No. The tiling you just introduced (your line {len(input_solution_list)+1}) is different in length from the previous ones.'
repeated: 'No. The well-formed tiling you just introduced (your line {len(input_solution_list)+1}) is the same as the entry number {input_solution_list.index(line)+1}.'
your-formulas-all-ok: 'All the tilings you have introduced are ok (well formed).'
one-formula-is-missing-no-feedback: 'No. Your set is missing at least one well-formed tiling.'
one-formula-is-missing-no-feedback: 'No. Your set is missing at least one well-formed tiling.\nConsider for example:'
one-missing-minimal-prefix: 'No. Your set is missing at least one well-formed tiling.\nHere is the prefix of a well-formed formula that is missing from the set you entered:'
not-consecutive(last): 'In green you find the longest prefix that a solution you are missing has in common with a solution you have given:'
first-missing-till-already-present: 'In green you find the longest prefix that a solution you are missing has in common with a solution you have given:'
one-missing-prefix-length: 'No. Your set is missing at least one well-formed tiling.\nHere is the prefix of length {length} of a well-formed formula that is missing from the set you entered:'

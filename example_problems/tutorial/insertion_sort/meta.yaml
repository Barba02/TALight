  log_debug_your_insertion_sort_bot:
    description: |+
     This service is meant to supervision and validate your understanding and/or implementation of the InsertionSort algorithm while also supporting the authonomous discovery of this classical algorithm. The idea is to consider the InsertionSort algorithm as a recipt for operating an abstract InsertionSortMachine offering a restricted set of possible primitive operations on an expandable internal array (where the already sorted integers are stored) and a temporary buffer (where to load a new incoming integer). Upon execution of each one of these primitive operations, the abstract machine yields a predetermined log line that unambiguosly represents what has happened. The possible operations of the abstract InsertionSortMachine can be inferred by the list of the possible log lines (one for every operation):  
        #LOG_load_next_input_element_in_tmp_buffer <val>
        #LOG_flush_tmp_buffer_on_pos <i>
        #LOG_clone_to_its_right_ele_in_pos <i>
        #LOG_compare_what_in_tmp_buffer_with_what_in_pos <i> <outcome>
        #LOG_output_final_sorted_array <final_array>
     The service validates your correct understanding/implementation of the InsertionSort algorithm by check the coherence of the resulting log sequence, or signals the very first anomaly in behaviour based only on such log lines.
     The abstract machine is designed in such a way that there exists a unique recipt for operating it in such a way to always guarantee the success in ultimately outputting as final array the sorted list of incoming elements, whatever these elements turn out to be in the future of the online process. And this unique corrept recipt essentially is the InsertionSort algorithm archetype.
     Therefore, your log lines can be checked step-by-step to correspond to the steps of an always-correct sorting algorithm operating the InsertionSortMachine. Moreover, since the InsertionSort algorithm is the unique such algorithm, the service offers the intended validation. Finally, this also means that when trying to operate this machine the problem solver is bound to discover the logic of the InsertionSort algorithm (even without any prior knowledge about this classic algorithm). 
     You can find examples of coherent log sequences in the `examples` public folder (public means that it is contained in the archive `insertion_sort.tar` that you get by issuing `rtal get insertion_sort`). These logs might clarify several points but, when entirely correct, are partially spoilering since they are produced by the InsertionSortMachine when operated according to the InsertionSort algorithm, whereas we insist on that this service has the potential to fully support an exercise where the problem-solver is asked to discover on its own (and deepen its understanding of) the logic of the InsertionSort algorithm.
     Another way to infer the set of operations and functioning of the abstract InsertionSortMachine is by reading its description and implementation in the public library `template_lib.py`. Again, public means that you get it by issuing `rtal get insertion_sort`. For sure, the `insertion_sort.tar` archive downloaded in this way will contain this python implementation, but if you work out implementations in other languages or other additions/improvements you can contribute them to the TALight open source project. Of course, reading and interpeting a library requires more experience in programming and requires some more time than just reading a few log examples, but it is anyhow good exercise and you might find stimulating trying yourself at it. If this is not for you this time, but you want to make sure to discover the InsertionSort algorithm logic on your own (exploring within the restricted model coming with our abstract machine), then you can limit yourself at reading logs of executions that where lucky in yielding the sorted sequence but could have gone bad (these logs are not unique as long as the ultimately feed-in elements are at least two); also such examples of log files are public.
     You can call this service by issuing `rtal connect insertion_sort log_debug_your_insertion_sort_bot` and then inserting the lines of log one by one or even in group (by copy&paste). However, you are also given the possibility to plug in (and hence validate) a bot of yours meant to implement the InsertionSort algorithm according to the abstract InsertionSortMachine model and sending the required log lines to stdout. The service will only receive what your bot sends to stdout and considers only the lines prefixed by "#LOG_", all other lines are ignored. What sent to stderr will appear on the terminal but will not go through rtal and the service server.
     When implementing your bot we suggest you to rest on an abstract InsertionSortMachine implementation library like `template_lib.py`. In this way, all logs will be produced for free as a byproduct meanwhile your bot only needs to operate the machine. Indeed, if you implement the InsertionSort algorithm as a recipt for operating the InsertionSortMachine then template_lib.py will take full care of the log messages.
     By a bot we mean any executable command that you managed to make executable on your local machine. In order to plug in your bot in a call to the service just issue something like:
        rtal connect -e insertion_sort log_debug_your_insertion_sort_bot -- fullname_of_your_executable_Insertion_Sort_bot example_array_of_ints.txt other_arguments_to_your_bot
     For example, on our local machine this could be:
        rtal connect -e insertion_sort log_debug_your_insertion_sort_bot -- bots/test_bot.py examples/inputs/array_of_9_ints.txt wait_for_receipt
     where `bots/test_bot.py` (or it could have been also `python bots/test_bot.py`) on our local machine would launch a process taking in the array of integers contained in the file passed as first argument and process it according to the InsertionSort algorithm implemented with reference to the abstract InsertionSortMachine in template_lib.py.
     As you can see, in our case this process (our bot) has two arguments: besides the name of the file with the input array of integers to be sorted (first argument) in this call we have supplied our bot also with a second argument which commands the process to wait for an immidiate confirmation at each line of log printed (see the intended use of the `wait_for_receipt` argument to the various methods of the InsertionSortMachine implemented in template_lib.py). You can do without this more refined synchronization; in fact, once you have realized and experimented what can be done with direct interaction with the service, you can make your own authonomous decisions on how to organize your bot so that its interaction with the service is functional for your puposes.
     For example, your bot is expected to read the elements to be sorted from a file, however: (1) the input vector could actually be hardcoded in your bot; (2) the format with which you store input vectors into a file is ultimately your own businness. If you prefer to adhere to our format for this (so that you can use our files) you can take as your reference the file `array_of_4_ints.txt` in the `examples` folder. This file comprises two lines:
       -the first line contains the number <n> of integers to be sorted. 
       -the second line contains <n> integer numbers separated by spaces.
     However, the format of this file and the way you organize the way your bot takes in the input array (as long as you do not require it from stdin, which is assigned to rtal when the bot is plugged in) is not a service\'s businness, you have freedom.
     Similarly, the use of the InsertionSortMachine is not mandatory (thus you can write you bot also in languages for which this class/library has not been offered yet) but then you must take inspiration either from a correct log file example or from template_lib.py, which you can also reimplement in another language and possibly contribute to this open source TALight project.
     What is mandatory, if you want to make use of this service, is that your bot, meanwhile getting the elements one by one and accomodating them to their currently proper place inside the array of collected elements, also sends to `stdout`  the correct log line whenever the abstract InsertionSortMachine performs a basic operation.
     If you write your bot in python, then you can conveniently use the class InsertionSortMachine implemented in the `template_lib.py` library.
     In any case, your bot will run on your local machine, operating on the instance contained in the `example_array_of_ints.txt` file (or any other file you might prefer), and a log about its working will be sent to `stdout`.
     It is important to know that you can launch and test your bot in separate; then, when you plug it into the service using the `rtal` command as shown above, the stdout of your bot will be sent directly to the service (and the stdout of the service goes to the stdin of your bot). The purpose of the service is to validate the correctness of your implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm by accessing its log messages.

  remote_insertion_sort_api:
    description: |+
     In a call to this service you plug in your insert_sort bot remotely running on an instance of us. Your bot will access the array to be sorted only through the following primities
        CMD_GET_DIM <n>
        CMD_LOAD_NEXT_INPUT_ELEMENT_IN_TMP_BUFFER [the server answers 1 if the operation is successfull and 0 when there are no other input elements]

        CMD_COMPARE_WHAT_IN_TMP_BUFFER_WITH_WHAT_IN_POS <i> [the server answers < or >= ]
        CMD_FINISHED
     the service will ignore all lines not beginning with the prefix "CMD_", and will ultimately tell whether the array is sorted but also confirm whether the algorithm executed was the Insertion Sort algorithm or signal the very first discrepancy in behaviour.

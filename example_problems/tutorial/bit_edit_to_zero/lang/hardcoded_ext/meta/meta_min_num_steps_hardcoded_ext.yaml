    description: "Have you conquered the puzzle? We give you a random natural number (in its binary representation) and you are asked to tranform it to number 0 using a minimum number of steps. However, by setting the argument \\'number\\' to \\'my\\' you are let to also specify the starting number. If you have conquered the puzzle you can assess your solution by passing a bot implementing it to the service. Otherwise, the service can be used to support your quest."

        explain1: -yes_no= provides the minimum possible amount of feedback.
        explain2: -smaller_or_bigger= tells whether the minimum number of moves is smaller or bigger than what stated.
        explain3: -true_val= if your answer for the length of an optimal solution is wrong then the service tells you the correct answer.

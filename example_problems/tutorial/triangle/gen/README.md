# HOW TO CHOOSE INSTANCES FROM THE CATALOGUE

The instances in this catalogue have been created to serve two main kinds of services, those who require just one triangle and those who require two of them. 
In particular, the service *"check_number_of_triangles_in_triangle"* needs two triangles to work. All the triangles in folders with "double" in their names 
fit better the purpose of this service, as the range *[MIN_VAL,MIX_VAL]* is minimum, so the number of occurrences of the small triangle in the big triangle is maximized.
Instances are so divided:

**INSTANCES IDs THAT ARE GOOD FOR SERVICES THAT REQUIRE JUST 1 TRIANGLE:** 1, 3, 4, 5, ..., 42
**INSTANCES IDs THAT ARE GOOD FOR SERVICES THAT REQUIRE 2 TRIANGLES:** 2, 43, 44, 45, ..., 82

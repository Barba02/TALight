# HOW TO GENERATE THE CATALOGUE

The Triangle problem has 2 kinds of instances, which are *single* instances or *double* instances. The single ones are optimized to provide a good instance for services like *check_feasible_solution*, *check-and_reward_one_sol* and *check_best_sol*, whilst double instances are the only ones that work for the service *check_number_of_triangles_in_triangle*.
Since each instance can be written in two different representations (*in_lines* and *pyramid*), there are 4 total formats you can get when you choose a specific instance.
When generating the catalogue, instances whose parameters are meant to fit the *single* instances are used to encode *double* instances too and viceversa, so generating bad instances. In order to overcome this problem, we suggest you to clean the catalogue and remove these bad instances by executing *clean_catalogue.py* as follows.

1) Move to the problem's *gen* folder

```
cd ~/TALight/example_problems/tutorial/triangle/gen

```

2) Execute *TAL_make_catalogue.py* to generate the catalogue

```
python TAL_make_catalogue.py ~/TALight/example_problems/tutorial/triangle/gen

```
                                                            
3) Execute *clean_catalogue.py* to delete the odd files that have been generated by the previous call 

```
python clean_catalogue.py

```

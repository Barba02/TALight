  check_sol_value:
    description: call this service to check whether the value of a path in a triangle of <n> rows is the optimal one (<risp>).
    evaluator: [python, services/check_sol_value_server.py]
    args:
      n:
        regex: ^([1-9][0-9]{0,1}|100)$
        explain: the number of rows of the triangle
        default: 5
      MIN_VAL:
        regex: ^(0|[1-9][0-9]{0,1})$
        explain: all numbers of the triangle are integers in the interval [MIN_VAL,MAX_VAL]
        default: 0
      MAX_VAL:
        regex: ^(0|[1-9][0-9]{0,1})$
        explain: all numbers of the triangle are integers in the interval [MIN_VAL,MAX_VAL]
        default: 99
      how_to_input_the_triangle:
        regex: ^(lazy|([1-9][0-9]{5,5}))$
        explain: you can either enter the code (random seed) of one of our instances <n,MIN_VAL,MAX_VAL,seed> defining a triangle you may have already encountered in other services for this problem or ask to enter your triangle once the service has started up (lazy)
      sol_value:
        regex: ^(lazy|(L|R){0,99}|[0-9]{1,4})$
        explain: this is the solution you consider as the best one for the triangle you chose. You can either insert the path you think leads to the best solution or you can insert the value of the solution you consider the best. You can also ask to enter your path once the service has started up (lazy).
      silent:  
        explain: if nothing is wrong with your solution for the triangle you have specified us (through seed) then the service runs silently; otherwise it explain what is the problem in clear.
        regex: ^(0|1)$

services:
  check_path_value:
    description: call this service to check that the value of a path in a triangle of <n> rows is what you think (<risp>). 
    evaluator: [python, services/check_path_value_server.py]
    args:
      n:
        regex: ^([1-9][0-9]{0,1}|100)$
        explain: the number of rows of the triangle
        default: 5
      MIN_VAL:
        regex: ^(0|[1-9][0-9]{0,1})$
        explain: all numbers of the triangle are integers in the interval [MIN_VAL,MAX_VAL]
        default: 0
      MAX_VAL:
        regex: ^(0|[1-9][0-9]{0,1})$
        explain: all numbers of the triangle are integers in the interval [MIN_VAL,MAX_VAL]
        default: 99
      how_to_input_the_triangle:
        regex: ^(lazy|([1-9][0-9]{5,5}))$
        explain: you can either enter the code (random seed) of one of our instances <n,MIN_VAL,MAX_VAL,seed> defining a triangle you may have already encountered in other services for this problem or ask to enter your triangle once the service has started up (lazy)
      path_value:
        explain: the service checks that this number equals or not the value of the path, that is, the sum of the values comprising the triangle which are traversed by your path.
        regex: ^([0-9]{1,4})$
      path:
        regex: ^(lazy|(L|R){0,99})$
        explain: you can either enter the path from the top vertex of the triangle (a sequence in {{L,R}}^(n-1)) or ask to enter your path once the service has started up (lazy)
      silent:
        explain: if nothing is wrong with your solution for the triangle you have specified us (through seed) then the service runs silently; otherwise it explain what is the problem in clear.
        regex: ^(0|1)$
        default: 0

        regex: ^(hardcoded|hardcoded_ext|en|it)$

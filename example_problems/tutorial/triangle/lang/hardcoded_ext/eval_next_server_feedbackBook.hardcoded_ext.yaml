not-correct: '# No. Your solution is NOT correct. The next wff is\n {risp_correct}. Not\n {risp}.'
seems-correct-weak: '# Ok. Your solution correctly computes the well formed tiling immidiately following a given one (checked with tilings of a corridor of dimension 1x{n}).'
not-efficient: '# No. You solution is NOT efficient. When run on your machine, it took more than one second to compute the next well-formed tiling of a corridor of dimension 1x{n}.'
seems-correct-strong: '# Ok. Your solution appears to be correct (checked on several instances).'
efficient: '# Ok. Your solution is efficient: its running time is polynomial in the length of the formulas it manipulates.'

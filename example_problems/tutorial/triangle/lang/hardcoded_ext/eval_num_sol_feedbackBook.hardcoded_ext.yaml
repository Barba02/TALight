not-equiv: 'No. You solution is not correct. The number of well-formed tilings of a corridor of dimension 1x{n} is {risp_correct}. Taken modulus {ENV["answ_modulus"]} this value boils down to {risp_correct % ENV["answ_modulus"]}. Not {risp}.'
seems-correct-weak: '# Ok.  Your solution correctly computes the number of well formed tilings of a corridor of dimension 1x{n}.'
not-efficient: '# No. Your solution is not efficient. Run on your machine, it took more than one second to compute the number of well-formed tilings of a corridor of dimension 1x{n} .'
seems-correct-strong: '# Ok.  Your solution appears to be correct (checked on several instances).'
efficient: '# Ok.  Your solution is efficient: its running time is logarithmic in the number of tilings it counts.'

#NOW THE PROBLEM SERVICE SPECIFIC SECTION:

not-correct: '# No. Your solution is NOT correct.'
seems-correct-weak: '# Ok. Your solution correctly computes the list of well formed tilings of a corridor of dimension 1x{n_tiles} using as criterion {sorting_criterion}.'
not-efficient: '# No. You solution is NOT efficient. When run on your machine, it took more than one second to compute the list of well-formed tilings of a corridor of dimension 1x{n_tiles}.'
seems-correct-strong: '# Ok.  Your solution appears to be correct (checked on several instances).'
efficient: '# Ok. Your solution is efficient: its running time is polynomial in the length of the tilings.'

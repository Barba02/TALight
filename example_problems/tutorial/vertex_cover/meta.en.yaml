    description: 'This service provides you with a solution for a given instance of the Vertex Cover problem. You can either upload the instance file on the `instance` filehandler of the service, using the `-f` option of the `connect` subcommand of `rtal`, or try to input your instance directly from the terminal (supported only in `only_strings` format) once the service has started. You may also specify a pseudo-random instance by providing its instance description for a selected generator. This last option might ease your calling this service on instances encountered with other services.'

Every generator requires the user to specify a set of values for the needed parameters (like e.g. the `seed`) in order to univokely obtain the resulting instance. This set depends on the generator. Valid values for this set of parameters (called the "instance descriptor") offer an "instance description" that univokely specifies the instance w.r.t. that generator.

  bounds:
    evaluator: [python, services/boundaries_driver.py]
    description: 'With respect to a reference (possibly weighted) graph G (which can be proposed by the service itself or by the problem solver) this service prompts the student for bounds (lower, upper, or both) on the minimum size/cost of a minimum size/weight vertex cover of G. A node cover of G is a set X of nodes such that every edge of G has at least one endpoint in S. A matching of G is a set of edges F such that no two edges in F have endpoints in common. For each bound declared, the problem solver should also provide a proof of validity in the form of an easily verifyiable certificate (more precisely, it should be possible to verify the certificate in polynomial time). Clearly, a node cover of size UB (resp., of total weight UB) is a valid certificate that the the minimum size (resp., minimum weight) of a node cover is at most UB. At the same time, a matching F of cardinality LB is a valid certificate that the minimum size of a node cover is at least UB. Indeed, every node cover should take at leat one of the two endpoint from each of the edges in F, and all these endnodes are distinct nodes. One possible goal for the problem solver is to provide both a lower bound and an upper bound (with certificates in the languages suggested above). Computing the minimum size of a vertex cover is an APX-hard problem, but can be 2-approximated. For this reason, a further viable and interesting challenge for the problem solver is to make sure that his upper bound is always at most the double of his lower bound. The problem solver could actually design a bot that interacts with this service so as to assure that this challenge is always reached. In the case of a weighted graph, then the notion of matching can be generalized as follows. Let w be the mapping that assigns to every node its weight. A function f that assigns a natural number to every edge of the graph is called a w-matching if for every node v of the graph the sum of the values taken by f on the edges incident to v is at most w(v). The value of a w-matching is the sum of the values taken by f over all the edges of G. It can be noticed that whenever a w-matching of value LB exists then every node cover of G has total weight at least LB.'

    description: 'An instance of the Vertex Cover problem consists of an indirect graph, defined by parameters such as the number of vertices used and the seed that generates edges of the graph. Call this service (`gimme_instance`) to get an instance of your likings in one of the supported formats. The instance may come from different sources (randomly generated or belonging to a catalog present on the server). The service can be used to get a random instance or an instance from the catalog. \ NYou can ask to save the instance in a file on your local machine and / or view it on the monitor. For your convenience, the format of this instance can be specified via the `instance_format` argument.'

        explain: 'Instances might either come from the catalogue or be generated on the spot. Choose an option among:\n     [catalogue] the service will return an instance taken from the catalogue of instances stored on the server. The instances in the catalogue are progressively numbered starting from 1. Use the argument `instance_id` to specify the instance you are interested into. Calling this service might not be the most convenient way to get an instance from the catalogue: the whole catalogue is public, that is, it is contained in the file \''collage.tar\'' you get downloaded on your machine by issuing `rtal get vollage`. Also, if you hold the whole repo with the problem in local (all sources) then this catalogue is automatically created issuing `make` for a complete set up of the problem on your machine (this is a necessary step when setting up the problem on a server).\n     [randgen_1] the service delivers you the pseudo-random instance produced by the named pseudo-random generator. Every generator requires the user to specify a set of values for the needed parameters (like e.g. the `seed`) in order to univokely obtain the resulting instance. This set depends on the generator. Valid values for this set of parameters (called the "instance descriptor") offer an "instance description" that univokely specifies the instance w.r.t. that generator. Make then sure to pass the desired values for all the service arguments corresponding to the parameters needed by the selected generator. Notice that passing the very same configuration of values you get the very same instance. This is helpful since it guarantees the reproducibility of any experiment and the possibility to use and explore a same instance with different services of this problem.'

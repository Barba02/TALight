lcs (longest common subsequence)

When you remove some of the characters in a string s, you obtain a new string which is called a subsequence of s.
For example, there are two possible ways to obtain subsequence "MAMA" out from the sequence "MAMMA".

In this problem, you are given two strings s and t and are asked to find a longest string which is both a subsequence of s and a subsequence of t. 

The problem offers several services that, even before submitting your solutions, can help you verify your procedures or your understanding.
For example, if you are left in doubt as to what a subsequence of a string is, you will find services that already allow you to play with this concept.

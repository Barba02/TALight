not-correct: '# No. Your solution is NOT correct. The correct rank is {risp_correct}. Not {risp}.'
seems-correct-weak: '# Ok. ♥ Your solution correctly computes the rank of well formed formulas (checked with formulas up to {n_pairs} pairs of parentheses).'
not-efficient: '# No. You solution is NOT efficient. When run on your machine, it took more than one second to compute the rank of a well-formed formulas with {n_pairs} pairs of parentheses.'
seems-correct-strong: '# Ok. ♥  Your solution appears to be correct (checked on several instances).'
efficient: '# Ok. ♥ Your solution is efficient: its running time is polynomial in the length of the formula it ranks.'

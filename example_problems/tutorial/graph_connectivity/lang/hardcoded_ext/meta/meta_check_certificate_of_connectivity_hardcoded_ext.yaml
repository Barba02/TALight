    n:
      regex: ^([1-9][0-9]{0,4}|1000)$
      explain: the number of nodes nodes of the graph

      regex: ^(lazy|([1-9]|[0-9]{5,5}))$
      explain: you can either enter the code (random seed) of one of our instances (n,seed) defining a graph you may have already encountered in other services for this problem or ask to enter your graph after the service has started up (lazy)
    silent:
      explain: if nothing is wrong with your spanning tree for the graph you have specified us (through seed) then the service runs silently; otherwise it explains what is the problem in clear.

explain-protocol: '# Each instance gives you a sequence of numbers T and then, on the next row, a sequence of numbers S. You should say whether S is a sub-sequence of T or not (1/0).'

seems-correct-strong: '# Ok. ♥  Your solution appears to be correct (checked on several instances).'
efficient: '# Ok. ♥ Your solution is efficient: its running time is linear in the length of T and S.'

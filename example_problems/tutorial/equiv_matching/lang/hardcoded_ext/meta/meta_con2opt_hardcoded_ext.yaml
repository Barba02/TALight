    description: this service poses you an instance of the maximum weight matching problem in its construction form and remains available as an oracle for the maximum weight matching problem in its optimization form. You can call the oracle as many times as you want but are asked to ultimately yield an optimal solution for the single construction question posed by the server at the very start of the exchange.

    description: this service poses you an instance of the maximum weight matching problem in its decision form and remains available as an oracle for the maximum weight matching problem in its construction form. You can call the oracle as many times as you want but are asked to ultimately answer yes or no for the single decision question posed by the server at the very start of the exchange.

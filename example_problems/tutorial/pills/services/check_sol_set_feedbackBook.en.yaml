at-least-one-line: 'No. You are required to enter at least one feasible treatment (possibly even just the empty one) before closing.'
first-line-not-feasible: 'No. Your very first treatment is not feasible.'
different_lengths: 'No. The treatment you have just introduced in your line {len(input_solution_list)+1} has different length than the previous ones.'
repeated: 'No. The treatment you have just introduced in your line {len(input_solution_list)+1} is the same as your {input_solution_list.index(line)+1}th one. But nothing is lost: this repetition will be ignored. You can go on.'
your-treatments-all-ok: 'All the treatments you have introduced are feasible.'
one-treatment-is-missing-no-feedback: 'No. Your set is missing at least one feasible treatment.'
give-missing-treatment: 'Consider for example:'
one-missing-minimal-prefix: 'As a strong hint, here is the prefix of a feasible treatment and no treatment in your set has this prefix:'

not-equiv: '# No. You solution is NOT correct. The number of feasible treatments with {n_pills} pills is {risp_correct}. Taken modulus {ENV["answ_modulus"]} this value boils down to {risp_correct % ENV["answ_modulus"]}. Not {risp}.'

not-efficient: '# No. Your solution is not efficient. Run on your machine, it took more than one second to compute the number of feasible treatments with {n_pills} pills.'
seems-correct-strong: '# Ok. ♥  Your solution appears to be correct (checked on several instances).'
efficient: '# Ok. ♥  Your solution is efficient: its running time is logarithmic in the number of treatments it counts.'

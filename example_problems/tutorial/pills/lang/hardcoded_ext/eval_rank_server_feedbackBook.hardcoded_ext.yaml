seems-correct-weak: '# Ok. ♥ Your solution correctly computes the rank of feasible treatments (checked with treatments up to {n_pills} pills).'

seems-correct-strong: '# Ok. ♥  Your solution appears to be correct (checked on several instances).'
efficient: '# Ok. ♥ Your solution is efficient: its running time is polynomial in the length of the treatment it ranks.'

seems-correct-weak: '# Ok. ♥ Your solution correctly computes the feasible treatment immidiately following a given one (checked with treatments up to {n_pills} pills).'
not-efficient: '# No. You solution is NOT efficient. When run on your machine, it took more than one second to compute the next feasible treatment of this last treatment with {n_pills} pills.'
seems-correct-strong: '# Ok. ♥  Your solution appears to be correct (checked on several instances).'
efficient: '# Ok. ♥ Your solution is efficient: its running time is polynomial in the length of the treatments it manipulates.'

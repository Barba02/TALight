#NOW THE PROBLEM SERVICE SPECIFIC SECTION:

at-least-one-line: 'No. You are required to enter at least one feasible treatment (possibly even the empty one) before closing.'
first-line-not-feasible: 'No. Your very first treatment is NOT feasible.'
wrong-first: 'No. The very first treatment you have introduced is feasible but it is not the first feasible treatment according to the order that has been set.'
called-with: '(service called with'), end=" '
different_lengths: 'No. The treatment you have just introduced in your line {len(input_solution_list)+1} has different length than the previous ones.'
order-violation: 'No. The treatment you have just introduced in position {len(input_solution_list)+1} does not come after but rather before than the previous one according to the order set.'
repeated: 'No. The treatment you have just introduced in your line {len(input_solution_list)+1} is the same as your {input_solution_list.index(line)+1}th one. But nothing is lost: this repetition will be ignored. You can go on.'
your-treatments-all-ok: 'All the treatments you have introduced are feasible and correctly ordered.'
list-ok: 'You have listed all feasible treatments with {n_pills} pills. Also their order is the intended one.'
one-treatment-is-missing-no-feedback: 'No. Your list is missing at least one feasible treatment.'
give-missing-treatment: 'Consider for example:'
not-consecutive: 'In fact, the two feasible treatments:\n {input_solution_list[pos]}\n {input_solution_list[pos+1]}\nthat appear consecutive in your list are NOT consecutive in the intended order. You have missed something inbetween.'
first-missing-prefix: 'As a strong hint, here is the prefix of a feasible treatment and no treatment in your list has this prefix:'

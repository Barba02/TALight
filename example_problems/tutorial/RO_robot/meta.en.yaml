    description: "the input to the problem solver is an mxn grid some of whose cells are forbidden, while the others may have a gain value associated. This service provides feedback on the answer of the problem solver to one question out of many possible ones. The question could be the number of feasible paths between two cells of the grid, where a path is feasible if it traverses no forbidden cell and always move from one cell to the one just below or on its immediata right (diagonal moves might also be allowed setting the argument `diag`). Other questions currently served: the maximum value collected by a feasible path, the number of optimal paths. The service can also be asked to check the correctness of dynamic programming (DP) tables. In particular, the problem solver might have received a partial DP table and her task was to to complete it."

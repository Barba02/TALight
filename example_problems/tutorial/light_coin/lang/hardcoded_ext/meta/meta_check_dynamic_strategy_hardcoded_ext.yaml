    description: "Your goal is to identify the false coin in a set of n coins of otherwise equal weight. Choose an n and play a two-players game against nature: at every move you operate a scale to compare the weights of two disjoint subsets of the n coins and nature reports you the outcome."

    args:
      n:
        regex: ^[1-9][0-9]?$|^100$

        default: false_is_leighter
        explain: "choose the version of the puzzle among the following:"
        explain1: "[false_is_leighter]  you are given to know that the false coin is leighter."
        explain2: "[false_is_heavier]  you are given to know that the false coin is heavier."
        explain3: "[false_has_different_weight]  you are only given to know that the weight of the false coin differs, but do not know whether it is leighter or heavier."

        explain1: "[yes_no]  just confirm me that my strategy meets the goal."
        explain2: "[provide_counterexample]  please, when my strategy is not correct, provide me evidence of that. Also, when my strategy does not meet the goal, give me evidence of its failure in the form of a correct strategy with a smaller number of weighings."

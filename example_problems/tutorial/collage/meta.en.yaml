    description: 'This service provides you with a solution for a given instance of the Collage problem. You can either upload the instance file on the `instance` filehandler of the service, using the `-f` option of the `connect` subcommand of `rtal`, or try to input your instance directly from the terminal (supported only in `only_strings` format) once the service has started. You may also specify a pseudo-random instance by providing its instance description for a selected generator. This last option might ease your calling this service on instances encountered with other services.'

Calling this service might not be the most convenient way to get an instance from the catalogue: the whole catalogue is public, that is, it is contained in the file \''collage.tar\'' you get downloaded on your machine by issuing `rtal get collage`. Also, if you hold the whole repo with the problem in local (all sources) then this catalogue is automatically created issuing `make` for a complete set up of the problem on your machine (this is a necessary step when setting up the problem on a server).\n     [randgen_1] the service delivers you the pseudo-random instance produced by the named pseudo-random generator. Every generator requires the user to specify a set of values for the needed parameters (like e.g. the `seed`) in order to univokely obtain the resulting instance. This set depends on the generator. Valid values for this set of parameters (called the "instance descriptor") offer an "instance description" that univokely specifies the instance w.r.t. that generator.

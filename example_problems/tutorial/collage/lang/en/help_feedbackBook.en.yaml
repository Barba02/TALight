These pages can be translated in different languages and offer longer explanations than those from the synopsis service that deals more structured (and mainly autogenerated) information. Yet still, the help pages should be short and straight to the point as mainly meant to stimulate authonomous exploration on the services available and their best and creative use. You can find longer explanations and wider and wilder materials in the 'public' folder of the problem whose entire content (often placed in other folders and just symlinked from 'public') can be entirely dowloaded from the problem solver with access to the service publishing the problem collection. We further suggest to collect and make available links to pertinent resources both from the statement of the problem and from other easily identifiable collections placed within the 'public' folder.\n\n",

# What is TAlight

Are you a teacher/student/researcher/executive passionate about transmitting some problem solving competences, techniques, methods or skills? Do you want to acquire new competences or really promote them? Would you like to promote your discoveries or products? Would you like to propose an interesting and instructive challenge, or organize a selection or recruiting campaign?
<details>
<summary>TAlight offers you ...</summary>
TAlight offers you the perfect tool and open framework for making up your favorite problem into a fully fledged didactic inclusive Montessori toy, allowing to organize and offer smooth interactive didactic paths around it and automatic feedback services to promote autonomous exploration and learning.
Also the social and collaborative dimension is empowered in our TAlight approach and vision.

<details>
<summary>Do you want to acquire new competences?</summary>
Then we refer to you as a _problem solver_. If you can find out the content for you under TAlight, then both an active in-depth learning experience and pure fun are assured.
If no such content is already available, then think about making it while you progress in the subject. In this way you will be given a fun opportunity to learn by doing.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you want to transmit competences or assess them? Do you want to share or spread active knowledge on a subject or a complex tool or product?</summary>
Then you should consider becoming a _problem maker_ and forge your content in the form of compelling problems and services. The teachings you will put in there will be sought for and deeply absorbed, and the materials you prepare will be highly reusable.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you want to become a problem maker but know only one programming language?</summary>
Yes, the knowledge or the willingness to learn even just the basics of one single programming language of your choice, combined with the knowledge of your subject and the willingness to communicate and transmit an alive competence are just enough. If you have them you can already st up to make up an effective interactive problem truly hitting on the key issues that you want to dispel and share.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
TAlight is a minimal but powerful and flexible open system for the design, the sharing, the experimentation and the use of interactive didactic problems which offer rich ongoing instant feedback services to the problem solver (the student, or trainee, or employee, or fellow research colleague).
</summary>
Right now, most problems already available in TAlight are of an algorithmic nature. This is mainly because of our own background and because algorithms often represent the ultimate form of archetypal knowledge. However, we would not set/state limits as for now on what can be done and welcome any kind of sensibility and new muses. 
This repository offers the TAlight core plus some example problems working under it.
These problems prompt and stimulate the problem solver but are mainly meant to illustrate how making new interesting problems under TAlight is in your and in their reach. Also in their is an important point in our vision.
TAlight is meant to be simple to work with and highly democratic.
Among its commitments, in our vision come:

1. no one left behind: the feedback provided to the students should be rich and stimulating.
2. brake on through to the other side: when solving problems and interacting with the system, problem solvers should grow autonomous and get the desire and competence to become problem makers on their own. In fact, this will be the true mark on how much they have learned and grown.
3. to be a problem maker the knowledge of one single programming language of your choice (and just the basics of it) should be enough. Our ambitions are high, we know that competences, experience, and knowledge can go much beyond the mere tools.
4. possible to design didactic projects articulated on problems meant as Montessori games.
5. possible for teachers to share and collaborate on these didactic projects.
6. no installation required, neither for the problem solvers nor for the problem makers.

## How to get TAlight running on your machine

There are more solutions, the simplest ones are less rewarding, hence we leave them for last.
You are reading the `README.md` file of an open source project that aims at fostering a wide collaboration network and your skills included the collaborative ones. `Git` is the empowering technology to get the best from open source projects.
Therefore, though not necessary if you want to play on your own, we warmly suggest you to first get `git` installed on your machine.  

<details><summary><strong>How to get git and its power</strong></summary>

Whatever is your platform (Linux, Mac, Windows, ...) the [Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) of the [Git Community](https://git-scm.com/community) will give you the best updated instructions on how to install this game changer on your machine. If your are a Windows user, we limit ourselves to remark their suggestions ("We’ll learn more about those things a little later, but suffice it to say they’re things you want.") to get the command line version of git as well as the GUI.

Even if you do not make any other more advanced use of git, having it installed will simplify other steps in the installation process to follow and, more importantly, will allow you to better connect to this repo or other reports (possibly of TAlight problems). Even if you do not intend to contribute to their ongoing development, this means that it will be easy for you to maintain updated your local version of their contents and get the new exercises and/or features currently under development. To get the updates just launch the command

```t
git pull
```
from any directory of the repo. (In case you have overwritten some files of the repo then a conflict arises. This prevents the downloading of the new content (otherwise your modifications will go lost). If you are stucked in this situation and do not want to delete your modified files before pulling the official version of the repo, then you can simply move your modified files to some other folder or rename them with new names so that the conflict (the risk of loosing work you have done) will be resolved.) 

However, we also advise you to get at least a rough idea of what git has to offer you. Again, the [Documentation page of the Git community](https://git-scm.com/doc) is an ideal place where to get directions.

The main reasons for you to get into `git` are: not only `git` offers you important facilities (free and robust) like backups and working directories that you can in simplicity share among your devices, and powerful and intrinsically safe time machines over them and on your work, but it offers you the means to share and collaborate on your projects and, in fact, it is the portal to the world of open source projects (git was designed by Linus Torvalds in order to scale up its projects concerning the development of the Linux operating system to a wide collaborative dimension).
Not only TAlight is open source software, but we foresee and foster that problem makers from different countries/regions (but maybe of a same discipline) might collaborate on more or less open didactic projects.
</details> 

___
Now, the best and simplest option you have is to download this repo through git, so that you will remain connected with this open source projects and have the opportunity to easily update.

<details><summary><strong>Download this repo (assuming you have `git`)</strong></summary>
Assuming you have `git` installed on your machine:

1. open a shell (that is, a terminal, or cmd, or power shell)
2. go to your home directory, and enter:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/romeorizzi/TAlight.git
```
to download the content of this repo.
Of course, you can achieve the same result by any other means if you prefer.

You can also download and/or place the TAlight folder in any other directory of your preference as long as you interpret the following instructions accordingly.
</details> 

___

If for some reason you do not have and do not want to install `git` on the machine you have currently at hand, then you can anyhow download and test TAlight both in connection to TAlight problems served in the cloud and/or those contained in the tutorial we offer here in this battery included repo. In this way you might find out what TAlight might offer you before installing anything, or you can use it or show it to others on a laboratory or public library machine on which you have no installation rights.
<details>
Press the green button at the top of this GitHub page (the page of the repo).
Choose to download a compressed file, then uncompress it on your machine and locate it accordingly to your preferences. The only thing that will be missing will be the hidden `.git` directory.
</details> 

Whatever was your way out to it, in the following we assume that `~/TAlight` is the path to this TAlight repo on your system. Of course, you are free to rename it at your will or place it elsewhere as long as you interpret the following instructions accordingly. For example, if you use programs like Github Desktop to manage your git repositories, you are given to choose the location of the repo on your local machine. Please, feel free to place the repo folder according to your preferences or conventions. We will anyhow call it `~/TAlight` in the following instructions. Just replace `~/TAlight` with your path. E.g., `~/text` becomes `~/yourpath/text`.


## OBTAIN THE BINARIES

TAlight consists of two programs, the `rtal` client, and the `rtald` server. Both are needed both by the problem solver and by the problem maker. The problem maker will also use the `rtalc` checker.
After downloading this TAlight project public repo, you can either choose to use the binaries made available for your platform (not yet made available at present) or compile them from the source code.
How to make these two binaries and the basic on how to use them is explained in the file `rtal/README.md` of this repo.

In the following we assume that the files `~/TAlight/rtal/target/debug/rtal` and `~/TAlight/rtal/target/debug/rtald` exist (possibly with a different placement, as explained above) on your machine and have execution permission.
You can check this by asking them to display out their main help page.

```bash
~/TAlight/rtal/target/debug/rtal --help
~/TAlight/rtal/target/debug/rtald --help
~/TAlight/rtal/target/debug/rtalc --help
```

These pages will list out the parameters and subcommands of these three `TAlight` commands.

## SETUP OF THE PATH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE

Having to remember and digit the whole path `~/TAlight/rtal/target/debug/` in order to use the `TAlight` commands will soon appear too lengthy.

<details>
<summary>To solve this ...</summary>
To solve this, if you are on Unix/Linux/Mac, you can enter the following command in the terminal:
```bash
PATH=$PATH:/Users/MariaCamilla/Documents/GitHub/TAlight/rtal/target/debug/
```
You will have to do this on every terminal from which you want to issue TAlight commands.


There are many ways to solve this nuisance, like copying the binaries into a directory listed into the `PATH` environment variable on your system, or adding the path `~/TAlight/rtal/target/debug/` to your `PATH` environment variable.
Here we suggest a convenient way to make the `TAlight` commands directly accessible, it can be applied on any platform that allows for simlinks (or hardlinks). We word it out step by step for Unix/Linux/Mac: 


From the terminal,
lounch the following commands
```bash
mkdir ~/.bin
cd ~/.bin
ln -s ~/TAlight/rtal/target/debug/rtald ~/.bin/
ln -s ~/TAlight/rtal/target/debug/rtalc ~/.bin/
ln -s ~/TAlight/rtal/target/debug/rtal ~/.bin/
ln -s ~/TAlight/TAL_utils/TA_send_txt_file.py ~/.bin/ 
```

Then, add the following line at the end of your `~/.bashrc` file.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.bin"
```

Remember that this update will be effective only for terminals you open after having modifyied the `~/.bashrc` file.
If you want older terminals to get the update then you can issue from them the command
```bash
source .bashrc
```

Again, you can check that the `TAlight` commands are now directly accessible with

```bash
rtal --help
```
and

```bash
rtald --help
```
</details>

## TUTORIAL (How to use TAlight)

In all the examples we offer in this tutorial we assume the use of a POSIX-like shell.
Even if you aim at the problem maker role we suggest you to first exploit the first of these two tutorials currently available.

<details><summary><strong>START UP TUTORIAL</strong></summary>

#### PREAMBLE

Once the two executable `rtal` and `rtald` are built and conveniently available then you can already use `TAlight` both in local and in connection to an external server exposing TAlight problems and other material for a course, a didactic path or project, a competition, a scouting selection, a challenge, or a game.
Whether you are a problem solver (usually a student) or a problem maker (usually a teacher, or a senior student), a general truth and assumption in `TAlight` is that working first in local, whenever possibile, is the best way to experiment, learn and develop. You go out in the wide when ready. Active learning is better organized as a multistage process.

After downloading this repo you already have on your machine 
a set of working test problems to experiment with, and this section offers you a tutorial on them.
The first thing to understand is the way the server and the client interact. This can be confusing at first but every mistery will soon be dispelled. Though the `rtald` command might not be necessary (at least in principle) to the student in certain settings, for experimenting with the problems in our tutorial you need to launch both the server and the client and let them interact. The server `rtald` is the daemon and you need to activate it first, then you can issue many requests to it through the client `rtal`. The server offers two main modalities of activation:

1. `rtald` activated to serve requests concerning problems sitting on your local machine and coming from the local client.

2. `rtald` activated to serve requests concerning problems sitting on your local machine and coming from clients on other machines but reaching it through the internet. In this case your `rtald` daemon will need the bind address and the port from where to listen from the outside world and on which to establish connection with other `rtald` daemons.

In this tutorial we start with examples concerning modality 1 since all main features appear there.
In particular, this is certainly true with the problems of this tutorial that are entirely public and already downloaded with this repo.
Moreover, working in local prompts you to action, makes for a more concrete understanding, and fosters your experimental attitudes and skills which is one of the goals of `TAlight`.
As a problem solver, the time to connect to the internet comes only when you want to work on problems that (in full or in part) are not openly published (competitions, exams, didactic reasons, privacy reasons, copyright reasons, ...) or to multiplayer problems or games.
As a problem maker, you should consider offering the services for a problem from an internet server when your aim is to manage a competition, scouting selection, exam, or you want to offer a challenge through the internet with some control on the flow of information (for example when with your problems you want to instruct a client to the use of a product). Or possibly when you want to offer a very user friendly and attractive service.

When creating a problem and designing, implementing and experimenting its services within `TAlight` you do not need to offer these services online through an internet server. You can experiment them in local and share them by other means with other problem solvers or makers and collaborators to that project. Each of these recipients will have the possibility to make them alive in local with the open source `TAlight` platform.
In good conclusion, you need modality 2 almost only to offer a service on the web for problems where some services to the problem solver require pieces that for some reason you do not want to make public. Though the example problems are fully public (you download them as a whole with this repo), still their directory structure is organized as they were not. In the public directory of a problem it is customary to place links to all the materials of the problem that can be made public without spoilering in any way the problem (as for its intended use). 

In the case of the problems of this tutorial the whole of the materials comprising them is included in the directory with their names.
Nonetheless, one of the first uses of the `rtal` client you will see in this tutorial is how to get the public material for a problem.



## STARTING THE TAlight DAEMON

To operate with problems you have on your local machine, you first activate the `TAlight` daemon `rtald` on your machine to serve requests coming from your machine itself (modality 1).
When starting the daemon, it is a good idea to first turn on logging, by setting the environment variable `RUST_LOG=info`.
<details><summary>How to correctly set the environment variable `RUST_LOG=info`</summary>

We first show you a way to do it that works on the standard shells of Linux or Mac (`bash`, `sh` or `zsh`). It therefore works also on Windows sinc we assume you operate from the terminal you have installed together with `git`. It can also work on every terminal that allows you to switch to a bash shell by means of a `bash` command invocation.  
Insert the following command in the terminal from where you intend to launch the daemon `rtald` and monitor its interactions and working: 
```bash
export RUST_LOG=info
```

You can check that the environment variable is set with:  
```bash
echo $RUST_LOG
```
If it is correctly set than you get the string "info" in the following line, otherwise you get an empty line if the variable is not set. 

The simplest and most effective way to unset all environment variables set up for the current terminal after its instantiation? Just close the terminal and open another one. But usually there is no need for a refresh.
</details>


Both in modality 1 and in modality 2, you must specify to the daemon the directory containing the `TAlight` problems it should take care of. It is assumed that this directory is located on your local file system and each problem is a direct subdirectory of it.
In the case of the problems comprising this tutorial they are placed in the `~/TAlight/problems` directory. Therefore, you activate (in modality 1) the `TAlight` daemon with the following command from a terminal where the `RUST_LOG` environment variable has been set:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info rtald -d ~/TAlight/problems
```
The `rtald` daemon is now active and ready to serve requests concerning the problems present in the directory `~/TAlight/problems`.
The terminal where you issued its activation will now be the place where the server `rtald` updates you about the requests of service it receives and what is going on with them. If `RUST_LOG` was not set, then you will only get the error messages of the problem service server (the one called when you issued a request through the `rtal` client), if it crashes or malfunctions, but if the environment variable was set you will have access to further feedback that can help you out. 

The help page of the `rtald` command lists its optional parameters that allow you to expose the service in the wide rather than just in local (modality 2).
Still, when creating and experimenting, you will launch `rtald` as above and operate with no need for an internet connection. Only at deploy time (and if the intended use asks for it) you will expose services for your problems to requests coming from the outside (modality 2).
One way to stop the daemon is to `Ctrl-C` when the focus is on this terminal.

Anyhow, now that the `rtald` daemon is active and ready to serve our requests for a collection of problems, we are going to access the services available for these problems through the `rtal` client.  
 
Since the previous terminal is now the downstream channel of the daemon you have activated, in order to enjoy and explore the services it gives you access to, you need to open another terminal. Better yet, rather than opening another terminal, I actually suggest you to vertically split the terminal into two, let the left panel to the visualization of this logging, and issue the `rtal` client commands in the right panel so that you will keep constantly aware of the interactions between the two (expecially useful for the problem maker).

<details><summary>How to split a terminal into two or more</summary>

On Linux, the easiest way to do this is to use `Terminator` as your terminal. It also manages with high simplicity the possibility to multicast your typings on preselected subsets of the variuous panels you have open (though not needed here, this is a feature missing in all other tools here mentioned). In the web it is easy to find good tutorials and videos presenting the functionalities of Terminator and how to access them.

To [install Terminator on Linux](https://dev.to/xeroxism/how-to-install-terminator-a-linux-terminal-emulator-on-steroids-1m3h):
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome-terminator
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install terminator
```

On Mac, the best solution is [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), but if you have other suggestions ...

On Windows, the best solution is [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/), but if you have other suggestions ...

<details><summary>Avvio all'uso di ConEmu</summary>

Dopo aver pigiato il tasto "Download" offerto sulla [pagina ufficiale di ConEmu)](https://conemu.github.io/), seleziona "ConEmu Preview+Alpha, Installer (32-bit, 64-bit)" come raffigurato di seguito:
![image](./figs/ConEmu_download.png)
e procedi con l'installazione.

Al momento dell'utilizzo di ConEmu (in particolar modo a partire dal paragrafo della repo denominato "STARTING THE TAlight DAEMON") assicurarsi di aprire bash di Git (non la shell cmd che ha i suoi ben noti limiti) nel seguente modo:

+ digita sulla tastiera "Win+Shift+W" (o scegliere l'opzione "Finestra nuova console")
![image](./figs/new_console1.png)

+ assicurati di avere nella selezione per la nuova console la bash di GIT e spuntare l'opzione per dividere lo schermo
![image](./figs/new_console2.png)
In questo modo si avrà una finestra divisa in due terminali. Mi è stato riferito che il combo bash di GIT + ConEmu migliora di molto l'esprienza d'uso del terminale per utenti Windows.

</summary>

Actually, if you want to invest more on this, a more powerful solution is [Tmux](https://dev.to/srbruning/making-your-terminal-more-productive-with-tmux-2497) on all three platforms. Not only this has the extra benefit to be platform independent (bringing Linux, Mac, and Windows on a common ground) but it also allows you to manage sessions.
Indeed, Tmux is a [terminal multiplexer](https://linuxhint.com/tmux_vs_screen/) like `screen`, that may sit on any other basic terminal of your preference. While `Tmux` does not allow session sharing with other users it is however more user-friendly than `screen` and, for this reason, among the two we recommend `Tmux`. TMux is highly configurable, also allowing for projects whose editing is simplified by a [tmux sessions manager](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator).

</details>

First, to list the problems available, and thus check that both the client and the server are working, try the following command:
```bash
rtal list
```
In the list of available problems at least the example problem `sum` should appear.

If you want to know more about the `list` subcommand of `rtal` you can, as for any other subcommand, try

```bash
rtal list --help
```

## Exploring the services available for a problem

To explore the services available for the example problem `sum` try issuing
```bash
rtal list sum -v
```
For this first `rtal` problem-set specific request, and for all the others that will follow, be told that if you want to address them to another server made available online (and serving the same problems) you simply need to use the `-s` option that is mentioned when you run `rtal --help`.

Either way, you should get something like
```bash
- sum
  * sum
    # lang [it] ^(en|it)$
    # num_questions [10] ^([1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|30)$
    # numbers [twodigits] ^(onedigit|twodigits|big)$
    # obj [any] ^(any|max_product)$
  * sum_and_difference
    # lang [it] ^(en|it)$
    # num_questions [10] ^([1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|30)$
    # numbers [onedigit] ^(onedigit|twodigits|big)$
  * sum_and_product
    # lang [it] ^(en|it)$
    # num_questions [10] ^([1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|30)$
    # numbers [onedigit] ^(onedigit|twodigits|big)$
```
From this you understand that three services (`sum`, `sum_and_difference`, and `sum_and_product`) are up for this problem on your local machine. All three services will conduct a dialogue where you (or a bot you designed to act in your place) will be asked 10 questions (all instances of a problem defined by the service). Indeed, 10 is the default value for the parameter `num_questions`. You can specify a different value for this parameter (in the next example it is set to 13) but it can take only integers in the interval $[1,30]$ as specified by the regexp `^([1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|30)$` reported above.
To know how to interpret (if a problem solver) or write (if a problem maker) these regexps, we refer you to [regexp syntax](https://docs.rs/regex/1.4.3/regex/#syntax).
You can also change the default values of the parameters by editing the `meta.yaml` file in the directory of the problem. For example, try changing the default value for the `lang` parameter as specifyied in the `meta.yaml` file.
Not all parameters that `rtal` sends to the daemon to adapt the behavior of the services are specified in the `meta.yaml`.
For example, for all problems you can ask that the feedback is sent to you in black and white even when `rtal` detects that your `tty` supports the use of the colors. You can enforce the suppressing of the colors in any case with the `-no-color` flag (`-n` is its short form). You get to know about these service-agnostic flags and parameters by issuing `rtal connect --help`.

Combining the problem specific information you got above by issuing `rtal list sum -v` with the TAlight core instructions you get with `rtal connect --help` you could decide to try one of the following two services:

```bash
rtal connect -a num_questions=13 -a numbers=big sum sum_and_product
```

```bash
rtal connect -a numbers=big sum sum -- sum_mysolution.py
```

In the first case you will enjoy a direct interaction with the server through the terminal (this can be enough or anyhow play helpful to find out about the service and the protocol of the interaction).
In the second case you connect your local solution program or bot `sum_mysolution.py` to the server to check out how your method you have therein encoded performs.
Clearly the file `sum_mysolution.py` must have the correct permissions in order to be executed on your local system. In other words the file must be an executable, but otherwise any programming language could have been used to produced it. 
If you want to observe the interaction between your bot and the server you can issue:

```bash
rtal connect -e -a numbers=small sum sum -- sum_mysolution.py
```

Problem `sum` also exemplifies how to interact with a service through a browser rather than through the terminal.
In this way and by resorting on HTML/CCS/JavaScript technology, nice applets running on the problem solver site can be designed for more user friendly interactions.
Just look in the `applets` directory of the project (`~/TAlight/applets`) and open the file `sum-protoapplet.html` in a browser.

<details><summary>How to open a file on your local machine in a browser</summary>

On Linux:
```bash
~/TAlight/applets$ google-chrome sum-protoapplet.html
```
On Mac:
```bash
~/TAlight/applets$ open -a "Google Chrome" sum-protoapplet.html
```
On Windows, Linux, Mac: open a browser and in the URL field at the top insert:
```t
file:///home/romeo/TAlight/applets/sum-protoapplet.html
```
</details>

In this file, it is easy to spot out and substitute the hardcoded problem-specific parts and get an analogous page for a first browser mediated interaction also for other problems. One can start from here in order to develop ad-hoc applets specific to other problems and offer fun active learning opportunities also to kids that do not yet know how to code.

##

Here is how to use the `rtal` client in order to get the public material for a problem.

```bash
rtal get eggs 
```
After issuing this program you will find a file named `eggs.tar` in your current directory. If you untar this file a directory `eggs` will hatch. Inside this directory you will find all the material of the problem that the problem solver has decided to make public (simply putting symlinks to those files and folders in the directory public).
Notice that among the materials that the good problem solver has decided not to make public is the file `correct_table.txt`. Do you see the reason why?
Launch

```bash
diff -r eggs ~/TAlight/problems/eggs/public 
```
to see other differences and ask yourself the reason why.

Yes, problem `eggs` is the next problem of our tutorial.
But, before leaving problem `sum`,
visualize its statement.
We suggest you to use your browser. To do so, first set up your browser so that it can correctly visualize plain Markdown files sitting on your local machine.
In the case of `chrome` how to do this is explained [here](https://imagecomputing.net/damien.rohmer/teaching/general/markdown_viewer/index.html).
Then,
```bash
rtal get sum
tar -xvf sum.tar
google-chrome sum/statement/statement.it.md
```
Of course, you could have visualized this file even before asking for the `public` folder of problem `sum`, since the whole of problem `sum`, including its `public` directory and its `statement` where already sitting on your machine as part of the `TAlight` repo (or you could have browsed this Markdown document from there, in the internet). We are however happy that you read this document for last, both as a problem solver and as a problem maker.
Then,
to grow as a problem maker, run
```bash
diff -r sum ~/TAlight/problems/sum/public 
```
and ask yourself the reasons for these more refined differences.

<details><summary><strong>TUTORIAL FOR THE PROBLEM MAKER</strong></summary>

Clearly, problem making is an art. More than we can say is already in your hearth and passion. Our only intention here in this section is to smooth your way to acquire our tools.

Take a problem you have to:

1. think about the competence you want to transmit and see if you can pose challenges that make it alive and try to go deep on it.

2. compose a document containing the statement of the problem, and think of services that could support, guide, stimulate the problem solver.  

3. summarize these services into the meta.yaml file in the root of the folder of the problem.

If you lounch:

```t
tree ~/TAlight/problems/sum 
```
you will discover the main directories usually comprising the problem folder.
These are:

1. `statement`  is the folder were we keep the statement which can be in any format you might prefer (.txt, .tex, .pdf, .doc, .mp4, .mov, ...) and produced with your preferred tools. This folder can contain docs in various languages, and also multimedia.    

2. `services` is the folder were we organize and obtain the executable codes providing the services. It usually contains one subdirectory for every service.
    In the examples of the tutorial at the next level we have directories for various languages since we want to show to the problem maker that and how he can use the programming language he prefers. There is no need to write more than one code for a same language. One single code in a language of your choice will serve all students (irrespectively of the programming languages they use, if any).

3. `meta.yaml` contains a list of the services with information on the executable to call to satisfy a request and on the possible parameters for these calls.
It is a good idea to begin compiling this file while organizing the statement and taking decision on the problm you want to propose and its services.
The incormation here collected is what is returned by commands like

```t
rtal list morra -v
```

Please, compare the output of this command and what written in the file `meta.yaml`.
Also, try to modify some f its line, like for example substituting
the lines
```t
  sum_and_difference:
    evaluator: [services/sum_and_difference/python/advanced/sum_and_difference_server.py]
```
with the lines
```t
  sum_and_difference:
    evaluator: [services/sum_and_difference/python/simple/sum_and_difference_server.py]
```
in the `~/TAlight/problems/sum/meta.yaml` file 

This should allow you to test the simpler versions of codes that serve the intended service. See how simple serving a problem can be before entering in the (only superficial) obfuscations coming with colored outputting and multilingual support.
As you can see, both for problem `sum` and for problem `morra` all services are implemented both in a simple and in an advanced manner. Starting from the simple and then looking at the advanced should help your way through to all the little proficiency needed on the technical level, and ready to express yourself on the creative side of problem making.

There is also a service for checking whether a `meta.yaml` file is fit:

```t
rtalc ~/TAlight/problems/sum
```
it should out no line of error since/when this file is ok.

## Vision (pezzi in Italiano)

Miriamo al promuovere lo sviluppo distribuito e condiviso di percorsi didattici funzionali alle proprie esigenze e finalità. Se diverrà facile per i docenti (e loro studenti) contribuire con problemi, ciò consentirà la realizzazione di un repository di percorsi didattici per problemi che possa venire costituito e popolato di problemi in modo distribuito e condiviso, in vari contesti e discipline.
TAlight non richiede alcuna installazione.
TAlight consente di affrontare in locale sia la soluzione che il design, la realizzazione, e testing in locale di un problema.
Al momento del deployment di servizi sul problema al docente basterà disporre di un web server modesto che potrà facilmente approntare senza spese. 
In futuro potremmo mirare a fornire noi stessi dei servizi di hosting gratuiti che forniranno ambienti per percorsi didattici spendibili in esercitazioni, lezioni, gare, o allenamento aperto. I problemi potranno così essere condivisi e percorsi didattici basati su problemi potranno essere realizzati in una rete collaborativa, come specifici a particolari esigenze e percorsi svolti in scuole lontane ed altrimenti isolate.

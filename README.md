# What is TAlight

Are you a teacher or passionate about transmitting some problem solving competences/technique/methods or proposing an interesting and instructive challenge?
TAlight offers you the perfect tool for you to make up your favorite problem into a full fledged didactic inclusive Montessori toy, allowing to organize and offer smooth interactive didactic paths around it and automatic feedback services to promote autonomous exploration and learning.
Also the social dimension is empowered:

Do you want to become a problem maker but know only one programming language?

TAlight is a minimal but powerful system for the design, the sharing, the experimentation and the use of interactive didactic problems which offer rich ongoing instant feedback services to the problem solver (the student or trainee).

Most problems in TAlight are of an algorithmic nature.
This repository offers TAlight plus some example problems working under TAlight.
These problems prompt and stimulate the student and are meant also to show how making new interesting problem under TAlight is in their and in your reach.
TAlight is meant to be simple to work with.
Among its commitments in our vision come:

1. no one left behind: the feedback provided to the students should be rich and stimulating
2. brake on through to the other side: when solving problems and interacting with the system, problem solvers should grow autonomous and get the desire and competence to become a problem maker
3. to be a problem maker the knowledge f one single programming language of your choice (and just the basics of it) should be enough
4. possible to design didactic projects articulated on problems meant as Montessori games
5. possible for teachers to share and collaborate on these didactic projects
6. no installation required, neither for the problem solvers nor for the problem makers.

## GENERAL USAGE

The TAlight consists of two programs, the `rtal` client, and the `rtald` server.
After downloading this TAlight project public repo, you can either choose to use the binaries made available for your platform (not yet made available at present) or compile them from the source code.
How to make these two binaries and the basic on how to use them is explained in the file `rtal/README.md`.

If you are a problem solver (usually a student), then you will need only the `rtal` client.
If you are a problem maker (usually a teacher, or a senior student), then you will need both programs.Still, when creating and experimenting, you will launch both programs on your local machine with no need for an internet connection, and, only at deploy time you will publish your problems and services on some server where `rtald` is up and running.

## Vision (pezzi in Italiano)

Miriamo al promuovere lo sviluppo distribuito e condiviso di percorsi didattici funzionali alle proprie esigenze e finalità. Se diverrà facile per i docenti (e loro studenti) contribuire con problemi, ciò consentirà la realizzazione di un repository di percorsi didattici per problemi che possa venire costituito e popolato di problemi in modo distribuito e condiviso, in vari contesti e discipline.
TAlight non richiede alcuna installazione.
TAlight consente di affrontare in locale sia la soluzione che il design, la realizzazione, e testing in locale di un problema.
Al momento del deployment di servizi sul problema al docente basterà disporre di un web server modesto che potrà facilmente approntare senza spese. 
In futuro potremmo mirare a fornire noi stessi dei servizi di hosting gratuiti che forniranno ambienti per percorsi didattici spendibili in esercitazioni, lezioni, gare, o allenamento aperto. I problemi potranno così essere condivisi e percorsi didattici basati su problemi potranno essere realizzati in una rete collaborativa, come specifici a particolari esigenze e percorsi svolti in scuole lontane ed altrimenti isolate.

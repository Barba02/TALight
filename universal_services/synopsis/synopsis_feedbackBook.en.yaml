ruamel-missing: 'Internal error (if you are invoking a cloud service, please, report it to those responsible for the service hosted; otherwise, install the python package \''ruamel\'' on your machine).'
ruamel-required: ' the service \''synopsis\'' needs to access .yaml files in order to provide you with the information required. As long as \''ruamel\'' is not installed in the environment where the \''rtald\'' daemon runs, the service \''synopsis\'' can not perform.'

regex-cloud-resource: '\nAll arguments of all TALight services take in as possible values only simple strings that can be streamed from the \''rtal\'' client to the \''rtald\'' daemon (and finally acquired as environment variables). For each argument, the family of allowed string values is described by means of a regex.
